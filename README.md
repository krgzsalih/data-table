## To Run the Project

### Back-End

- Firstly we have to install our fake backend which is Json Server.

  - At the main directory of project, right click to `backend` folder and select `Open in Integrated Terminal`.
  - And install json-server;
  - ```
    npm install -g json-server
    ```
  - After installation of json-server, we have to run json-server to fetch our data's with command line like below;

  - ```
    json-server --watch api.json --port 6161
    ```

- Our server is ready. Now, take a look for Front-End.

### Front-End

- ```
  npm start
  ```
